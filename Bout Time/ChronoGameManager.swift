    Steps to start:
    1) Populate 6 rounds of data with 4 events T=24
    2)


    Manager will handle the current round, score etc.

    View Controller will create the manager object.
    Set-up labels based on the array 'currentRound' in the manager object.

    When the user presses the buttons we can call a shift function which will mutate the 'currentRound' object
    Then we update the labels in the view controller
        REPEAT UNTIL:
        - Time lapses or,
        - User shakes device

    When one of these things happens:
     - The manager will need to check the order of the currentRound array which is an array of Events. It can do this by checking the date Int.
     - Each successive item should be greater than the previous.
     - How does the manager inform the view controller of the correct order etc / what is right and what is wrong (kinda relying on both objects being in sync a bit
